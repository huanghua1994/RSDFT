RSDFT -- a matlab code for real space Density Functional Theory.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This suite of matlab scripts perform self-consistent field (SCF) 
iteration for solving the Kohn-Sham equation.. 

1. Main driver: The main driver is main.m - this reads the same
   input data file as parsec. [similar operation to PVOX via a 
   python parser]. To run the code start matlab and type main.
   This will run the example with the input file parsec_in.dat 
   in this directory (this is the same input file as PARSEC, 
   but only a few of the data lines are actually read).

2. The main SCF code is in rsdft.m which calls:

3. Three diagonalization options are provided -- 1) Lanczos for the
   first iteration and chefsi1 thereafter. 2) Lanczos all the time
   3) Chebyshev iteration all the time

4. The conjugate gradient algorithm is used to solve the Poisson equation

5. A few choices of mixers -- these are in the directory MIXER. 
   
6. Various other functions : exchange correlation potential -- translated
   from parsec, and.. 

7. Pseudopotential functions pseudoDiag and pseudoNL 
   [currently being worked on]
