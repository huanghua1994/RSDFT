This folder contains a set of multi-secant mixers (namely msecant1.m,
msecant2.m, and msecant3.m) for RSDFT. The simple mixing code
(simplemix.m) is also included.

CONTENTS:
=========

 ../mixer.m   : This file specifies which mixer to use (simplemix.m,
                msecant1.m, msecant2.m, or msecant3.m).
 includemix.m : This file sets the arguments for mixing (such as mixing
                parameter, Broyden-like or EN-like, restarting factor).
 simplemix.m  : Simple mixing with only the latest iterate.
 msecant1.m   : Multi-secant mixing method, with update by minimizing
                the change of approximate Jacobian in Frobenius norm.
 msecant2.m   : Multi-secant mixing method, with update by minimizing
                the change of approximate inverse Jacobian in Frobenius
                norm.
 msecant3.m   : A hybrid multi-secant mixing method, with update by
                minimizing the change of approximate Jacobian or
                inverse Jacobian depending on the secant errors in
                Frobenius norm.
 qinv.m       : Multi-secant mixing methods involve solving linear
                systems with multiple right-hand sides. Here Household
                QR factorization is used numerical stability while
                computing the inverse.
 qinv2.m      : One can use pseudo-inverse to increase the numerical
                stability, by replacing qinv.m by qinv2.m. On the other
                hand pseudo-inverse is computationally more expensive
                (because of SVD).
